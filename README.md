# Reverse-an-Array
The main thing is that we usually reverse an array using decrementing by loop but not saving it after reversed.
and can use another array for saving but considering space complexity
a large number of files,folders(here digits)etc takes a lot of memory.
here,using the same memory space with swap logic, we achieved the reversed array.
